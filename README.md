Application to help players crack 5 letter word games

This app helps to solve a five letter word game such as Wordle.

I used simple tools 🔨 to develop the app and any beginner can follow along the code. The purpose of the app is to demonstrate my knowledge 📚 of JavaScript and also, to allow players of games to get the easiest way out when stuck.

New versions and improvements will uploaded ⬆️ to this repository. Users may folk the repo however, credit should be given to me, through mention of name.

The code is not perfect! Feel free to send me suggestions and improvements!

You can send me an email on: mwariwada@gmail.com if you have questions or would like to donate 😬.

Known bugs:
+ You can enter numbers and other non-alphabetic characters as the second character in an input field.
